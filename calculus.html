        <p>
          The development of calculus was driven by the study of the natural
          universe. Calculus's origin takes place in the late 1600s, where a plethora
          of natural philosophers(people who studied and the natural universe and used
          math to explain physical phenomena)
          were battling with problems which could not be solved with the then-current
          tool set provided by math. These problems include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the velocity of an object constantly changed, how could we determine
            the distance that the object travelled?
          </li>
          <li>
            If an object is oddly shaped(curved), how could we determine its area
            and volume?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These problems may seem trivial to you if you already know calculus.
          Obviously, we can simply just use our handy-dandy differentiation rules
          like the chain rule and our beloved integration techniques like
          partial fraction decomposition, but unfortunately the calculus tool set
          was not readily available to natural philosophers before the late 1600s.

          There were a plethora of natural philosphers around the time that
          calculus invented. The following are some prominent figures along with
          what they did.

          A lot of people would argue that Leonhard Euler is the greatest
          mathematician of all time, and they would be justified in claiming
          that. Euler was not just a mathematician, he studied a wide range
          of subjects, including: physics, astronomy, philosophy, and engineering.
          And his contributions to various fields were certainly not trivial.
