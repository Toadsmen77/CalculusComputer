# Calculus Computer
Calculus Computer is a front-end web-based app which executes calculus computations. I was motivated to create this project when I was slaving away on my
calculus homework and became curious as to how I could automate the arduous computations. There were already existing calculus computers
online(such as Wolfram Alpha) and I was really fascinated by them, so I wanted to learn how they worked; thus, this project was born! This computer is comprised of two components, one for each major branch of calculus: <b>derivative calculator</b> and <b>integral calculator</b>.

<h2>Derivative Calculator</h2>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/P9dpTTpjymE">A good song</a></p>
Computer for derivatives of single variable mathematical functions.
<i>♫ It's as easy as can be, just have to take dx/dt, I will derive, I will deriiiive! ♫ </i>

<h2>Integral Calculator</h2>
My integral calculator uses numerical integration(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule">Simpson's rule</a>)
to approximate definite integrals. I attempted to program symbolic integration for indefinite integrals, but it was too hard lol.
In addition to using Simpson's rule, I also used <a href="https://api.mathjs.org/">mathjs</a>, a RESTful API to help me execute
complex computations.

<h3>Credits</h3>
I programmed the computer myself, but I used algorithms and data structures which were already invented. Here are links to
the resources I used to learn how to implement a calculus computer:

<h3>Fun Note, and Some History of Computers!</h3>
<p>
If you've snooped around my Github, you may have noticed that I have quite a few projects which are math calculators.
My gravitation towards programming calculators is very reminiscent of the early history of computers in general.
Many early computers follow the same pattern:
they wanted to automate math computations.
A lot of people may claim that the very, very first computer to ever exist is the Abacus, a calculation tool which was created
around 5000 years ago. However, others would claim that the very first computer is Napier's bones, a tool created by the mathematician
John Napier in the early 1600s to execute multiplication operations. Other very early computers included:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Stepped Reckoner: a device which executed basic arithmetic calculations, invented by Gottfried Leibniz<b>(who also invented calculus!)</b></li>
  <li>Atanasoff-Berry Computer: a device which solved systems of linear equations(kind of like my linear algebra computer?). This machine was invented by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry. </li>
</ul>
<p>
I wanted to point out this history because I realized that I had quite a few calculator projects on my Github, and it reminded me greatly
of the early history of computers, and how much of its early motivation was from wanting to automate math calculations!
