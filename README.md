# Calculus Computer
Calculus Computer is a web-based program which executes calculus computations. I was motivated to create this project when I was slaving away on my
calculus homework and became curious as to how I could automate the arduous computations. There were already existing calculus computers 
online(such as Wolfram Alpha) and I was fascinated by them, so I wanted to learn how they worked. The computer is comprised of two
components, one for each major branch of calculus: <b>derivative calculator</b> and <b>integral calculator</b>(integral calculator not implemented yet).

<h2>Derivative Calculator</h2>

<i>♫ This problem would be mine if I just knew that tangent line... ♫ </i>
Computer for nth order derivatives of single variable and multivariable mathematical functions. 
<i>♫ It's as easy as can be, just have to take dx/dt, I will derive, I will deriiiive! ♫ </i>
<h2>Integral Calculator</h2>

uuuhhhh TBD lol

<h3>Credits</h3>
I programmed the computer myself, but I used algorithms and data structures which were already invented. Here are links to
the resources I used to learn how to implement a calculus computer:

<p>^This guy invented calculus :0</p>

<h3>Fun Note, and Some History of Computers!</h3>
<p>
If you've snooped around my Github, you may have noticed that I have quite a few projects which are math calculators. 
My gravitation towards programming calculators is very reminiscent of the early history of computers in general.
Many early computers follow the same pattern:
they wanted to automate math computations.
A lot of people may claim that the very, very first computer to ever exist is the Abacus, a calculation tool which was created
around 5000 years ago. However, others would claim that the very first computer is Napier's bones, a tool created by the mathematician
John Napier in the early 1600s to execute multiplication operations. Other very early computers included:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Stepped Reckoner: a device which executed basic arithmetic calculations, invented by Gottfried Leibniz<b>(who also invented calculus!)</b></li>
  <li>Atanasoff-Berry Computer: a device which solved systems of linear equations(kind of like my linear algebra computer?). This machine was invented by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry. </li>
</ul>
<p>
I wanted to point out this history because I realized that I had quite a few calculator projects on my Github, and it reminded me greatly
of the early history of computers, and how much of its early motivation was from wanting to automate math calculations!
