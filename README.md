# Calculus Computer
A web-based program which executes calculus computations. I was motivated to create this project when I was slaving away on my
calculus homework and became curious as to how I could automate the arduous computations. There were already existing calculus computers 
online(such as Wolfram Alpha) and I was fascinated by them, so I wanted to learn how they worked.


<h2>Derivative Calculator</h2>

Computer for nth order derivatives of single variable and multivariable mathematical functions. 
<h2>Integral Calculator</h2>

uuuhhhh TBD lol

<h3>Credits</h3>
I programmed the computer myself, but I used algorithms and data structures which were already invented. Here are links to
the resources I used to learn how to implement a calculus computer:

<p>This guy invented calculus :0</p>

<p>Calculus is awesome!</p>
