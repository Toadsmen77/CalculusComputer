# Calculus Computer
A web-based program which executes calculus computations. I was motivated to create this project when I was slaving away on my
calculus homework and became curious as to how I could automate the computations. There were already existing calculus computers 
online(such as Wolfram Alpha) and I was fascinated by them, so I wanted to learn how they worked.
